Introduction
InstaChat is not just your ordinary chat application; it's a portal to alternate realities where chatting is not just a conversation but an adventure! Connect with users across different dimensions and experience conversations that transcend space and time.

Features
Multiverse Messaging: Chat with users from parallel universes. Are they using emojis we haven't even discovered yet? Probably!
Time-Bending Texts: Send messages that arrive before you even send them. Stay ahead of your conversations!
Quantum Encryption: Your messages are so secure, not even a quantum computer can crack them. Your secrets are safe across dimensions!
Center of the Universe UI: Our UI is so centered; even black holes are jealous.
Getting Started
